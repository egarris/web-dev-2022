# Web Development 2022

Looking to hone your skills as a web developer, become a stronger software engineer and implement modern industry practices?

We are a group of software engineers and teaching fellows [@Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) passionate about education! This repository contains source code, assets and videos for our live workshops held on December 2021. Our lineup consists of

- [React Hooks](https://github.com/iseykim/react-hooks)
- [Portfolio Building with Gatsby.js](https://github.com/AmberAbreu/codyportfolio-boilerplate)
- [Git Workflow](https://github.com/andrea-e-c/git-workflow)
- Project Management
- [Wireframing and Prototyping in Figma](./wireframe-figma/README.md)
- [Firebase](https://github.com/margaritadanshina/todo_firebase)
- Ethics in Engineering
- [Patterns in Algorithm & Datastructure](https://github.com/toriekim/problem-solving-patterns)

## Setup

This repository uses `git subtree` to pull from remote repositories into a centralized origin. ~~To pull latest changes, simply run the `pull-repos` script.~~ Simply `git pull` to get the latest update. The script is more for internal uses to keep up to sync with the children repositories (but feel free to dig around).

```bash
# Give execute permission
chmod +x ./pull-repos

# Run the command
./pull-repos
```

## Usage

We will be doing live demos and pushing changes from our respective workshop and remote repository. As such, it is recommended to sandbox your own modification and exploration in a separate branch to keep the merge strategy straightforward. For instance, if you want to follow along with the `react-hooks` demo, make a branch first. At the end of the workshop, switch to `main`, and run `pull-repos`.
